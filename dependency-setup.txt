How to set up dependencies on a clean headless linaro for Parallella:


Run "parallella-setup.sh"

OR

Step 1: Go to para-para example, in parallella examples
  Why? It has all the basic dependencies for the examples
Step 2: Copy all the commands from the readme into a shell script
  Why? I'd mistype something tbh if I copied it myself
Step 3: Run 'sudo ln /opt/openmpi/bin/* /usr/local/bin'
  Why? It's installed somewhere other than where the build scripts expect it
Step 4: Edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add '/usr/local/browndeer/lib'
  Why? The linker doesn't know about the location by default and the install process doesn't add it.
