# parallella

Assorted code and info for the Parallella board and parallel computing. More coming soon.

To set up the dependencies for a board, run the `parallella-setup.sh` script. If using the old HDMI-enabled image, make sure the eSDK version is 2013.5.
The headless version works with the newer (2015) release, since it has updated drivers.
